# Dale's Network Series Part 1!!

This program consists of a client and server which will transfer and store files remotely.  This solution is simplistic because it uses a _UDP_ protocol.


Note: __THIS IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. UDP protocol offers no 
guarentee a file will be recieved and is quite unreliable.__


You can build the client and server with the 'make' command.  Launch server with './server _portnumber_' and you launch client with './client _serverip serverport_'.


The commands at your disposal are...  

   push 'filename'  
   pull 'filename'  
   delete 'filename'  
   ls  
   exit  

#### Good times!
