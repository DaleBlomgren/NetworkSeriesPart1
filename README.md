# Dale's UDP File Transfer!!

This program consists of a client and server which will transfer and store filesremotely.  This solution is simplistic because it uses a _UDP_ protocol.


Note: __THIS IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. UDP protocol offers no 
guarentee a file will be recieved and is quite unreliable.__


You can build the client and server with the 'make' command.  Launch server with './server <port number>' and you launch client with './client <server ip> <port number>'.

The commands at your disposal are...
..* put 'filename'.
..* get 'filename'.
..* delete 'filename'.
..* ls.
..* exit.

#### Good times!
